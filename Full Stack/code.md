* **Static Webpages:** Simply using HTML and CSS
* **Interactivity:** Using JS and TypeScript
* **External Packages:** Node.js is JS runtime for server, while Node Package Manager for libraries on client/browser end. 
In order to dig the node modules to find location of package to add in HTML, JS module **Bundler(webpack)** will build system files for final output(script) which is browser compatible(no require/import statements)
**Babel/TypeScript** helps transpile code to browser compatible ones. Each time JS is changed, re-run the webpack.
**Task Runner - npm scripts** automates parts of build process
* **Collaborative Work:** **Git** is a free and open source distributed version control system (manage changes to software code). **Github** provides a collaborative environment.
* **FrontEnd Apps:** **React** and **Tailwind CSS**

* **CLI Apps:** Asynchronous event-driven Javascript runtime, hence no thread concurrency. Read/Write files, parse CLI/JSON/CSV, Make HTTP requests, use third-party API.
**PostgreSQL** is an open source relational database. Install server, and connect using *psql* in terminal and *pgAdmin* using Web.
psql -U postgres // SELECT current_database();
* **CRUD Apps:** Create, Read, Update, Delete todo app using Application Programming Interface built upon Representational State Transfer rules.
**JSON Web Token** are standards for compact way of transmitting information between parties via JSON objects.
